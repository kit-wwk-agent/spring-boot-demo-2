# Health Endpoint Security Posture:
# - No Spring Security is configured, so all health endpoints are publicly accessible
# - /actuator/health, /actuator/health/liveness, /actuator/health/readiness require no authentication
# - This allows Kubernetes probes and load balancers to access health endpoints without credentials
# - If Spring Security is added later, explicit permit rules will be needed for health endpoints
# - show-details: when_authorized hides component details from unauthenticated users in production
